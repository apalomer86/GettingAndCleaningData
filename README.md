# **Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project**

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Files included in this data set are:

* The original data set from the folder `UCI HAR Dataset`
* `Codebook.md` explains all the variables in the final tidy dataset
* `df_tidy.txt` is the file created from the `write.file()` function in `r_analysis.R`
* `r_analysis.R` contains the scripts needed to complete the assignment

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps 1-5 were completed in r_analysis.R

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
